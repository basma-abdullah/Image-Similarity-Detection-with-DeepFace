# Image-Similarity-Detection-with-DeepFace
Explore image similarity detection using DeepFace library for precise facial feature comparison in this GitHub project.

The "Image Similarity Detection with DeepFace" project leverages the DeepFace library to compare and identify similarities between images. This project focuses on developing a robust model that can effectively analyze and compare images based on facial features and characteristics.

Using DeepFace's advanced facial recognition capabilities, this project aims to provide a reliable solution for image similarity detection tasks. By utilizing deep learning techniques, the model can accurately measure the resemblance between different images, making it suitable for applications such as image deduplication, face verification, and content-based image retrieval.
